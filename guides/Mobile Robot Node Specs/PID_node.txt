Overview: This node receives wheel velocity commands from the path follower and drives the motors with a PID or other suitable controller. A lot of this code was written during some early labs. The changes are that this needs to be a node that interacts with ROS. This will likely be in a ROS node that talks to an arduino. This might be the same node that publishes Odometery data.
