Overview: Create a map of the field for localization and planning purposes. The map should include AprilTag location and orientations, tables and delivery locations, and walls. This will be used by the Localization Node to compare the AprilTag location seen through the camera to the ground truth location in the map. This will also be used to plan a path around the walls and to the goal location. Other programs should be able to easily access this information.
