Overview: Takes camera image and uses CV to output locations and orientations of ingredients and open pizza slots. Will use gamma filter, HSV color filter, noise reduction, blob detection, centroid/orientation calculation. Can use function that provides camera calibration info (ie, we can pass it a position/orientation in the image and the function returns a position/orientation in the world x,y,z frame)
